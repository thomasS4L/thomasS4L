Skills For Life aligns with the "Mindset Growth Model", which amplifies the importance of continuous learning and self-discovery. The concept was founded on the principles of exploring, confronting, and moving past failure to build on key transferable skills that can be practically applied to daily life.

We organize workshops, events, and other initiatives to fill the gap between traditional learning and practical skills. We are determined to help kids from all walks of life realize the tools they have within themselves to pursue their dreams.

## Our Goals

- To educate youth on the importance of Life Skills development, while helping them plan their future

- To connect people, groups, and organizations in order to build strong partnerships and enhance civic engagement
